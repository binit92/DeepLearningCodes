# DeepLearningCodes
 Projects from Udacity- DeepLearning Foundation Nanodegree Programme

## Installation
 To run this files succesfully , You can get started with Anaconda, and Jupyter notebook

* [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) - A package, dependency and environment manager 

**Useful commands ** 
```
conda list - 
conda upgrade conda 
conda upgrade --all

conda install numpy 
conda install numpy=1.10
conda remove numpy
conda update numpy
conda search beautifulsoup

conda create -n myEnv numpy
source activate myEnv      /OSX,Linux
activate myEnv		   /Windows

conda env export > envrionment.yaml
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda env list
conda env remove -n myEnv
```
(when sharing your code, it is good practice to create environment.yaml file)

* [Jupyter Notebook]
Notebooks are a form of "literate programming ". It automatically renders with Github. [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org) can render the notebooks from your GitHub repo or from notebooks stored elsewhere.

```
conda install jupyter notebook
```

**Keyboard shortcuts** 
* _Enter/Return_ - edit mode  
* _Enter+Shift_  -> next cell
* _h_ - Help menu
* _A/B_ - new cell
* _Y_ - Markdown to Cell
* _M_ - Code to Markdown
* _L_ - line numbers 
* _DD_ - deleting cell

## Projects 

 **Project 1. DLND Your first neural network**
 A neural network for  __Bike-Sharing Company__. The system predicts, how many bikes they need.
```
conda env create -f dlnd.yaml
```
MindMap:
* Real world examples of Deep Learning
* Types of Model (Supervised, Unsupervised, ReinforcementLearning), Dependent and Independent Variables
* What is Linear regression and what is logistic regression. take e.g. as Univeristy Entrance problem
* Neural Networks and types of Perceptrons
* Gradient Descent and Maths with entire dataset. How error minimized here, multivariate calculus, partial derivatives, learning rate, squared-mean error ?
* Multilayer Perceptrons and sigmoid function
* BackPropagation, Explain?
		
 Project 2. Image Classification
 
MindMap:
* Model Evaluation and Validation 
* How to create a test set for your models.
* How to use confusion matrices to evaluate false positives, and false negatives.
* How to measure accuracy and other model metrics.
* How to evaluate regression.
* How to detect whether you are overfitting or underfitting based on the complexity of your model.
* How to use cross validation to ensure your model is generalizable.
